title: What is a GUI?
---

**GUI** stands for 'graphical user interface', and it is pronounced like 'gooey'. 

If you have written Python programs before, these will probably have dealt with input as text typed in by the user, and with output appearing on the screen. 

Adding a GUI to your program lets the user interact with it using buttons, menus, text boxes, and other familiar user interface features.
