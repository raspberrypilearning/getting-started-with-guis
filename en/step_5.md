## Getting started

Before you start, make sure that you have installed the **guizero** library.

- Open up Python 3 (IDLE).

- Click on File > New File and save your file as `gui_test.py`.

- Add a line of code at the start of your file to import the App class from the guizero library:

    ```python
    from guizero import App
    ```

- Now add two more lines of code to create an `App` and then display it on the screen:

    ```python
    app = App(title="Hello world")
    app.display()
    ```

- Save your file and press F5 to run it. You should see a GUI window that looks like this:

Congratulations, you have built your first GUI app!
